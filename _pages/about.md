Hello everyone! I am an incoming PhD student at [Northwestern IEMS department](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/). I achieved my M.S. in Engineering degree at University of Texas at Austin, majoring in Operations Research. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jonathan F. Bard](https://sites.utexas.edu/bard/) at UT-Austin on my master thesis. Before that, I received my bachelor degree from Nankai University.My research interests lie in developing algorithms for optimization problems.
