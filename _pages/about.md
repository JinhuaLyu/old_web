Hello! I am second-year graduate student in the [Operations Research and Industrial Engineering Program (ORIE)](https://www.orie.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin. 

In my first year of study, I conducted research on EV charging network infrastructure allocation using Two-Stage Stochastic Program. Currently, I am focusing on solving the weekly schedule problem using Mixed-Integer Programming for my thesis project.

Before joining UT-Austin, I pursued Finance Management at Nankai University. However, my passion for Operations Research was ignited when I participated in an ICM mathematical modeling competition. I derive immense satisfaction from exploring mathematical models and applying them to real-life problem.
